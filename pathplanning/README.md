# Path Planning Workshop

Path Planning enables robots to navigate their environments safely and efficiently. In this workshop, we will provide an introduction to Path Planning and teach some fundamentals of implementing basic algorithms in Python. 

You don't need to have any prior knowledge coming into this workshop, as it is aimed towards students who are completely new to the process. We will cover topics such as:

- Graph/Node theory
- Basic graph search algorithms:
  - Breadth First Search 
  - Depth First Search  
  - Djikstra
  - Uniform cost search (UCS)
  - A* (A Star)


This workshop was developed in collaboration with [UQCS](https://github.com/UQComputingSociety).

  We will be using this pre-existing repository for implementation and visualisation of DFS and A*.

  Note: You may need to change the default map used. Replace the hex code in Functions.py/create_obstacles_from_hex.
  Here is one that works:

      def create_obstacles_from_hex(grid_world):
        hex_code = '0xc03c8348a0190649129100fa114001a142040a010095104744272239400441006018f1545a4100404114180ec028'
        ...

- Slides may be uploaded in the future.
