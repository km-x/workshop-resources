# Path Planning Workshop

Path Planning enables robots to navigate their environments safely and efficiently. In this workshop, we will provide an introduction to Path Planning and teach some fundamentals of implementing basic algorithms in Python. 

You don't need to have any prior knowledge coming into this workshop, as it is aimed towards students who are completely new to the process. We will cover topics such as:

- Graph/Node theory
- Basic graph search algorithms:
  - Breadth First Search 
  - Depth First Search  
  - Djikstra
  - Uniform cost search (UCS)
  - A* (A Star)


This workshop was developed in collaboration with [UQCS](https://github.com/UQComputingSociety).
